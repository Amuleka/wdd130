      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi, I’m Amulek, and I’m a computer programmer. I make music production easy for upcoming audio engineers, producers, songwriters, and singers/rappers. I create websites dedicated to artists, so they can approach their goals easier without expending too much money. The results are a 40% increase in communication and in orders throughout the website. 

        When was the last time you had a problem finding the right fit for you? Are you happy with how you connect with artists nowadays? That’s what I take care of! I make things go easier on both sides, so you can focus on creating your idea as well as possible! Let me take care of that hassle for you.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intention is to target upcoming artists who have the desire to develop themselves and to achieve their goals with hard work and collaboration. To me age is not a problem, if you have a dream, you should go for it, at least try it, you won't be able to forget yourself if you never tried what you love. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The main page will host examples of my beats so that the artist can choose between the beats they like more to purchase them. They can see my latest releases, the most popular ones, they can change the mood or key, BPM, etc. I will also host some purchase plans, so they can decide which plan suits them better. Prices can go from $9.99 to $199.99, depending on the type of beat they want. I will also have a navigation bar that can lead them to know more about me and my collabs or to watch some videos that are popular on my YouTube channel, so they can see which beats are most popular.
        If they want a mixing or mastering service, I can also do that, there is going to be a contact option down on the page and, they can subscribe to my newsletter or if they want to get an email every time, I release a new beat. If they want to collab, we can also work together on a project, I can co-produce, mix, master, or design the sounds from one of the beats you want. You can also send me a beat you like, and I can make something similar, not the same, but it can have the same feeling and power

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the time people want to know who you are and who's worked with you to purchase your product. If you don't have any experience working with artists, then they probably won't be buying your product. You need to know what you are doing and show that to the artists. 
        Even though I still feel like I am a beginner, I have worked with different artists with different genres. I have a producing, mixing, and mastering freelancing service on Fiveer.com that you can check out for more examples. With 5.0 Stars reviews I’m moving faster to the main page of Fiveer.com, so you can book your services with me anytime. I'm a music producer and audio engineer who has been involved in music since I was a kid. 
        Since I learned how to play the violin and guitar at a young age, my passion for music became an obsession with delivering the best results possible. I've been working recently with Bruce Kirby from Boho Digitalia Studios in Salt Lake City, and Dave Zimmerman from Noise Box Studios in Provo, both in Utah, I've been producing, mixing, and mastering my client's music, as well as my own music for a couple of years now. I love to work with any genre of music.      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Videos</h3>
      <p>
        I want to include some of the videos I've made for my YouTube channel so they can check popular beats and decide which one they want to purchase. Most of the time, people who see a popular beat purchase it, because they want to be in the mood of the moment. 
        Other people prefer not to do that because they think it’s already being played a lot of times, and people already know it. Some people like exclusive beats, while others want popular beats. Depending on the customer, I need to have 2 sections. One for my most popular beats, and one for the new beats I did that week. 
        I will normally submit 3-5 beats per week, so they can check which one they would like to purchase. For the new beats, I will submit a preview video, so they can check it out on my YouTube channel. Also on my YouTube channel, they will have a link to click on it to go to my website.      </p>

      <h2>
        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        In the body of the Home Page, I will have some beat examples. The new ones are always on this page. Normally they show up 6-8 examples. If the customer wants to hear more beats, they can click on the show all button at the bottom of the last beat.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>         
        This will be a paragraph about me and my accomplishments. How did I start in music production and how I started selling beats and working with artists.      </p>
      <img class="images" src="images/about.png" alt="Wireframe About">

      <h3>Videos</h3>
      <p>The whole body of the Videos page will only show my most popular YouTube videos. Some clients like to purchase popular beats to make a remix or just make a new song on top of the beat. Sometimes they ask you to change the beat a little bit so they can record a new song.</p>
